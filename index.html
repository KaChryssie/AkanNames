                <p id="intro">Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week
                    they were
                    born.
                    It is for that reason this web application was made,where people will be able to know at which day
                    of the week
                    they were born, basing on their gender detail and their birthday details they will provide through
                    the form.
                    Akan names are derived from the Ghanian culture, where they frequently name their children after the
                    day of the week
                    they were born and the order in which they were born.
                    These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
                    Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
                    ancestor's middle name.
